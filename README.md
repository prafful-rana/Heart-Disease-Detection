This ECG signal is a Time-series. Hence, we perform Time-series classification with the
help of deep learning neural network. We aim to achieve this in three ways, One being
a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN), second being a 1D Convolutional Neural
Network (1D-CNN) and the third being a hybrid dual input network (2D-CNN & 1D-CNN
inputs). We perform the Feature Extraction using two methods, One is the Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EMD) and the second is the Fourier Decomposition Method (FDM). We
then compare the results obtained using both the methods.
